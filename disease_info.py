        "symptoms":"Symptoms of acne on your skin include:\n\n"
        "1. Pimples (pustules): Pus-filled bumps (papules).\n\n"
        "2. Papules: Small, discolored bumps, often red to purple or "
        "darker than your natural skin tone.\n\n"
        "3. Blackheads: Plugged pores with a black top.\n\n"
        "4. Whiteheads: Plugged pores with a white top.\n\n"
        "5. Nodules: Large lumps under your skin that are painful.\n\n"
        "6. Cysts: Painful fluid-filled (pus) lumps under your skin.\n\n" ,

        "causes":"1. Acne is most commonly linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age.\n\n"
        "2. Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum).\n\n"
        "3. This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus.\n\n"
        "4. Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women.\n\n" ,
    
        "treatment":"1. Do not wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse.\n\n"
        "2. Wash the affected area with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse.\n\n"
        "3. Do not try to clean out blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scarring.\n\n"
